## ThirdPersonBoatign

**Do you like travelling in a boat in third person for the increased visibility?**

Me too! I always found it annoying how Minecraft keeps you in first-person by defualt. When you install this mod, your perspective will automatically be switched to third-person after entering a boat, and will be reset to first-person after exiting it!
